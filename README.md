#Frontend-Nanodegree-Arcade-Game Submission

This is my submission for P3 of the Front End Nano Degree

##How to run the game

You can download the files in this repository and then open the index.html file with your web browser.

##Rules

Start with 3 lives.

Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move around the board and dodge bugs.

Make it to the water, add a life.

Get hit by a bug, lose a life.

The more lives you have, the faster the new bugs will move.
